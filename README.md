Program training includes machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, data analytics/visualization, and ethical AI development. Training is followed by a "hackathon", where teams build products with AI/ML technologies to solve problems in affective computing.

### *Day 2 (February 9th, 2021)*: Introduction to Machine Learning and scikit-learn

Code and materials for today can be found [here](https://github.com/natasharavinand/SureStart/tree/main/Introduction%20to%20ML%20and%20scikit-learn).

Today introduced machine learning theory and applications, as well as model development in `scikit-learn`. The two discussion questions included:

 - What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning?
	 - The ultimate goal of many supervised learning problems is to come up with a predictor function (sometimes called hypothesis)  `h(x)`. Mathematical algorithms optimize this function such that given input data  `x`  (ex. square footage of a house), the predictor function can accurately output some value  `h(x)`  (ex. market price of house).
	 - The goal of unsupervised learning is to uncover patterns and relationships within data. In this case, there are no training samples. Some popular approaches include clustering (ex. k-means), dimensionality reduction (ex. principle component analysis) and more.
- Does `scikit-learn` have the power to visualize data by itself?
	- No. `scikit-learn` must be complimented by another library such as `Matplotlib` in order to visualize data.

### *Day 1 (February 8th, 2021)*: Welcome to SureStart!
Today was an introduction to the Spring 2021 SureStart program, an initiative connecting emerging AI talent to machine and deep learning curriculum. I am an undergraduate student at Yale University planning a tentative major in Statistics & Data Science. I'm interested in how to strategize, develop, and apply AI techniques to solve problems. I hope to strengthen my skills in AI/ML within the scikit-learn, Tensorflow, and Keras libraries. More broadly, I hope to develop skills in:

 - Unsupervised and supervised learning techniques
 - Deep learning and neural networks
 - NLP and computer vision
- Ethical AI development

I hope to eventually apply my technical skills in roles that require an understanding of AI/ML techniques to make data-driven decisions. Some fields that especially interest me are civic/progressive tech, climate tech, and fintech.
