Program training includes machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, data analytics/visualization, and ethical AI development. Training is followed by a "hackathon", where teams build products with AI/ML technologies to solve problems in affective computing.

### *Day 1 (February 8th, 2021)*: Welcome to SureStart!
Today was an introduction to the Spring 2021 SureStart program, an initiative connecting emerging AI talent to machine and deep learning curriculum. I am an undergraduate student at Yale University planning a tentative major in Statistics & Data Science. I'm interested in how to strategize, develop, and apply AI techniques to solve problems. I hope to strengthen my skills in AI/ML within the scikit-learn, Tensorflow, and Keras libraries. More broadly, I hope to develop skills in:

 - Unsupervised and supervised learning techniques
 - Deep learning and neural networks
 - NLP and computer vision
- Ethical AI development

I hope to eventually apply my technical skills in roles that require an understanding of AI/ML techniques to make data-driven decisions. Some fields that especially interest me are civic/progressive tech, climate tech, and fintech.
